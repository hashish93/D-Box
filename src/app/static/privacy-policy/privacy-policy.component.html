        contractual relationship with you or comply with a legal obligation.</p>

      <p><strong><em>B) Analysis and Development of New Products and Services.</em>
      </strong> <em> </em> We perform statistical, demographic and marketing analyses

        patterns, so we can analyze or predict our users&rsquo; preferences for product
        and services development purposes, to determine our promotional campaign
        effectiveness so we can adapt our campaign to the needs and interests of our
        users, and to generally inform advertisers about the nature of our subscriber
        base. We use this information for analytical purposes, including analysis to
        improve customer relationships, to support strategic business decisions and our
        marketing tactics and to measure and track our brand health. We will engage in

        a legal obligation, or because we have a legitimate interest in doing so.</p>

        provide personalized services because we have a legitimate interest.</p>

      <p><strong><em>D) Email Newsletters and Other Marketing Activities as well as
        Facilitating Social Sharing. </em> </strong> Piksels.tv will periodically
        send you email newsletters or promotional emails about services offered by
        Piksels.tv and its advertisers. To opt out of these emails, please see the section
        labeled <em>How do I opt out from receiving emails?</em> We will use the
        information we have about you to advertise our services to you on our Piksels.tv
        Services but also on other platforms. If you choose to use social-sharing
        functionalities, we will use your information to facilitate such action, and
        such action -- along with any information you share -- will be covered by the
        social-media platform&rsquo;s privacy policy. We will engage in these activities

        Promotions. </em> </strong> We may offer you the opportunity to
        participate in a sweepstakes, contest or other promotions. Some of these
        promotions have additional rules containing information about how we will use
        and disclose your personal information. We use this information to manage our
        contractual relationship with you.</p>

      <p><strong><em>G) Aggregating and/or Anonymising Personal Information.</em>
      </strong> <em> </em> We aggregate and/or anonymize personal information so that
        it will no longer be considered personally identifying. We do so to generate
        other data for our use, which we may use and disclose for any purpose.</p>

      <p><strong><em>H) User Generated Content and Public Activities.</em></strong> When
        you share or recommend links to content on a social-media platform (such as
        Facebook, Google+ and Twitter), that action and any information you share will
        be covered by that platform&rsquo;s privacy policy. Any information you disclose
        in your public activities, along with your screen name or ID, or any image or
        photo, becomes public.</p>

        Technologies. </em> </strong> We use &quot;cookies,&quot; Web beacons,

        Piksels.tv Services, recognize you and provide personalization, and help us
        understand how people use Piksels.tv Services. You will not be able to access
        certain areas of our websites, including piksels.tv, if your computer does not
        accept cookies from us. Because there is no accepted standard on how to respond
        to &ldquo;do not track&rdquo; browser-based signals, we do not respond to such
        signals. For more detailed information about our use of cookies and local
        storage, and how to manage them for the applicable Piksels.tv Service.</p>

        log files. This information include IP address , browser type, operating system
        and other usage information about the use of Piksels.tv Services, including a
        history of the pages you view.</p>

      <p>We automatically combine this collected log-information with other information we
        collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, including

      <p><em><strong>D) Location Information.</strong></em> Some of our mobile
        applications can deliver content based on your current location if you choose to
        enable that feature of the app, for example, by use of satellite, cell phone
        tower, or WiFi signals. If you enable the location-based feature, your current
        location will be stored locally on your device, which will then be used by the
        app. If you elect to have a location-based search saved to your history, we will
        store that information on our servers. If you do not enable the location-based
        service, or if an app does not have that feature, the app will not transmit to
        us, and we will not collect or store, location information. The ads in our apps
        are not targeted to you based on your current GPS location, but they are
        targeted to you based on your ZIP code or device&#39;s IP address.</p>

      <p><strong>5. Third-Party Advertising</strong></p>

      <p>Some of the services and advertisements included in Piksels.tv Services, including
        on piksels.tv and within our mobile apps, are delivered or served by
        third-party companies, which may collect information about your use of Piksels.tv
        Services.</p>

      <p>These companies place or recognize cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or other
        technology to track certain information about our Piksels.tv Services website
        users. For example, in the course of serving certain advertisements, an
        advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser in order to
        collect certain information about your use of the Piksels.tv Services. For another
        example, an advertiser or ad server may also be able to collect your device&rsquo;s
        unique identifier in the course of serving an ad. In many cases, this
        information could be used to show you ads on other websites based on your
        interests.</p>

      <p>We do not have access to, nor control over, these third parties&#39; use of
        cookies or other tracking technologies or how they may be used.</p>

      <p>For example, we use Google to serve advertisements on Piksels.tv Services, which
        use the Google Doubleclick cookie, and in some cases, a unique device
        identifier, to show you ads based on your visit to piksels.tv and other sites
        on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the Google Doubleclick cookie by
        visiting the <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/"> Google ad and content
          network privacy policy </a> . If you would like more information about this
        practice, and to learn how to opt out of it in desktop and mobile browsers on
        the particular device on which you are accessing this Privacy Policy, please
